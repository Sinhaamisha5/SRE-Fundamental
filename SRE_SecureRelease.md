# SRE Module: Secure Software Releases

## Overview

Security isn't just about the features you ship. It's about making sure the way you release software doesn't introduce risk. As SREs, we're often the last line of defense against insecure deployments.

> **"Security isn't just about application features, it's about not becoming tomorrow's cybersecurity news headline."**

---

## The Critical Truth

### Most Breaches Happen During Releases

**When?** During releases - when teams are focused on making it work instead of making it secure

**Why?** Most breaches don't happen because the code itself was bad, but because the **release process was weak**

---

## Three Major Security Disasters

### SolarWinds Hack (2020)

**What Happened**: Compromised build system

**Impact**: 
- Over 18,000 organizations affected
- Supply chain attack
- Nation-state level breach

**Lesson**: Build systems are critical attack vectors

---

### Log4Shell Incident (2021)

**What Happened**: Single vulnerable library discovered

**Impact**:
- Rippled across millions of applications worldwide
- Critical vulnerability in widely-used logging library
- Global scramble to patch

**The Divide**:
- **Mature security teams**: Identified and patched in hours with coordinated response
- **Immature security teams**: Took weeks to identify, responded reactively

**Lesson**: Dependency visibility and response speed matter

---

### Target Breach (2013)

**What Happened**: Stolen deployment credentials

**Impact**:
- Cost the company more than $200 million
- Customer data exposed
- Reputation damage

**Lesson**: Credential security is critical

---

## SRE: The Last Line of Defense

### The Reality

**Developers**: Wrote the code
**SREs**: Make sure it's deployed securely

**Security Teams**: Set the policies
**SREs**: Enforce them in practice

**Everyone Assumes**: Someone else is checking
**SREs**: Are the ones actually checking

### The Hard Truth

Most postmortems include lines like:
- "This could have been prevented"
- "This should have been caught at deployment"

**That's why SREs play such a critical role.**

---

## Three Biggest Risks in Release Path

### 1. Insecure Dependencies

**The Log4Shell Wake-Up Call**:

**Mature Teams** (Hours):
- ✅ Automated dependency scanning
- ✅ SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) available
- ✅ Knew which apps were affected immediately
- ✅ Coordinated, rapid response
- ✅ Patched in hours

**Immature Teams** (Weeks):
- ❌ No dependency visibility
- ❌ Manual audits required
- ❌ Weeks to identify affected services
- ❌ Reactive, chaotic response
- ❌ Panic mode

**Reality**: **70% of your code isn't yours** - it's dependencies built by others

**Statistics**: 
- Average app has 10-50 known vulnerabilities
- Usually at least a few critical ones

---

### 2. Misconfigured Permissions

**Example**: One wrong setting - making an internal S3 bucket public

**Impact**: 
- Critical data exposed to entire internet
- Customer data leaked
- Compliance violations
- Reputation damage

**Common Mistakes**:
- Overly broad IAM policies
- Public access accidentally enabled
- Default insecure settings not changed
- No review of permissions

---

### 3. The Vulnerability Domino Effect

**The Cascade**:

```
1. Popular library used everywhere in your stack
   ↓
2. Vulnerability discovered (often first in production)
   ↓
3. No automated dependency scanning
   ↓
4. Teams scramble for manual audits
   ↓
5. Thousands of services to check
   ↓
6. Result: Panic, chaos, weekend work, executive escalations
```

**This is the predictable outcome when visibility and automation are missing from the release path.**

---

## Security in CI/CD Pipeline

### Build Security Into the Pipeline Itself

Don't treat security as a separate step - integrate it into every stage.

### Tool 1: Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

**What It Does**: Scans your code for vulnerabilities before it ever runs

**What It Catches**:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Hard-coded credentials
- Buffer overflows
- Weak cryptography implementations
- Insecure deserialization
- Path traversal vulnerabilities

**When It Runs**: In CI/CD pipeline, before build

**Benefit**: Catches security issues before they reach production

---

### Tool 2: Dependency Scanning

**The Problem**: Modern applications are built on a mountain of dependencies
- **70% of your code isn't yours**
- Made up of dependencies built by others
- Average app: 10-50 known vulnerabilities

**What It Does**: Checks every library and package against databases of known issues

**Process**:
```
1. Build starts
2. Scan dependencies against CVE databases
3. If vulnerable version present → Build fails
4. Risk never makes it to production
```

**Benefit**: Shield against supply chain attacks

**Reality Check**: Hoping your dependencies are safe isn't a strategy

---

### Tool 3: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

**What It Is**: Like an ingredients list for your software - tells you exactly what's inside

**The Log4Shell Example**:

**Teams WITH SBOMs**:
- ✅ Knew in **minutes** which apps were at risk
- ✅ Immediate targeted response
- ✅ Fast remediation

**Teams WITHOUT SBOMs**:
- ❌ Spent **days or weeks** manually checking every service
- ❌ Guesswork and panic
- ❌ Slow, uncertain response

**Not Just Best Practice**: Regulatory bodies are starting to **require** SBOMs

**Tools**: Syft, Trivy, CycloneDX

---

## Four Best Practices for Secure Releases

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege ✅

**The Golden Rule**: Don't give services blanket access to everything

**❌ Bad Example - Overly Broad Permissions**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",              ← ALL ACTIONS
      "Resource": "*"             ← ALL RESOURCES
    }
  ]
}
```

**Problem**: Handing out the keys to the kingdom

---

**✅ Good Example - Least Privilege**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",           ← Specific actions only
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-specific-bucket/*"  ← Specific resource only
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefit**: Permissions limited only to what's needed

---

### 2. Automate Security Checks ✅

**The Truth**: Humans forget things, but computers don't

**Automated Checks in Modern CI/CD**:
- ✅ Dependency scanning
- ✅ Secret scanning (no hardcoded credentials)
- ✅ Static analysis (SAST)
- ✅ Dynamic testing (DAST)
- ✅ Container vulnerabilities
- ✅ Infrastructure misconfigurations
- ✅ License compliance
- ✅ Code quality gates

**Benefit**: Consistent, reliable security without human error

---

### 3. Review and Sign Artifacts ✅

**The Problem**: It's not enough to build code - you need to ensure the artifact deployed is the one you intended

**Tool**: Cosign (for container image signing)

**Process**:
```
1. Build image/binary
2. Sign it at build time with cryptographic signature
3. Store signature
4. Before deployment: Verify signature
5. Only deploy if signature matches
```

**Benefit**: Critical layer of trust - deploying a verified artifact that hasn't been tampered with

**Protection Against**:
- Supply chain attacks
- Compromised build systems
- Malicious image substitution
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

---

### 4. Monitor Continuously After Shipping ✅

**The Reality**: Security doesn't stop once you ship

**Continuous Monitoring Includes**:
- ✅ Subscribe to security advisories
- ✅ Set up automated CVE alerts
- ✅ Regular infrastructure reviews
- ✅ Regular application reviews
- ✅ Dependency update monitoring
- ✅ Security patch tracking

**Why It Matters**: New vulnerabilities discovered daily in existing dependencies

---

## Building a Secure Pipeline: Step-by-Step

### Starting Point (❌ Insecure)

**Problems**:
- Hard-coded credentials
- No scanning or SBOMs
- Overly broad permissions
- No deployment controls
- Blind and exposed

---

### Step 1: Remove Hardcoded Credentials

**Before**:
```yaml
- name: Login to Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
  with:
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
    password: "SuperSecret123!"  # ❌ Hardcoded!
```

**After**:
```yaml
# Set permissions at workflow level
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write
  id-token: write

- name: Login to Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
  with:
    registry: ghcr.io
    username: ${{ github.actor }}
    password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # ✅ Token-based!
```

**Benefit**: Token assigned at runtime, connected to GitHub account, granular permissions

---

### Step 2: Add Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

**New Steps Added**:
```yaml
- name: Install Security Tools
  run: |
    pip install safety bandit --break-system-packages
    
- name: Scan for Vulnerable Dependencies
  run: |
    safety check --json > safety-report.json || true
    
- name: Upload Security Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: security-report
    path: safety-report.json
```

**What It Does**:
- Installs security scanning tools
- Scans dependencies against vulnerability databases
- Generates report
- Fails build if critical vulnerabilities found

---

### Step 3: Generate SBOM

**New Steps Added**:
```yaml
- name: Generate SBOM
  uses: anchore/sbom-action@v0
  with:
    image: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
    format: cyclonedx-json
    output-file: sbom.json
    
- name: Upload SBOM as Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: sbom
    path: sbom.json
    
- name: Scan SBOM for Vulnerabilities
  uses: anchore/scan-action@v3
  with:
    sbom: sbom.json
    fail-build: true
    severity-cutoff: high
```

**What It Does**:
- Generates complete ingredient list
- Uploads for tracking
- Scans SBOM for known vulnerabilities
- Fails build if high-severity issues found

---

### Step 4: Add Container Scanning

**New Steps Added**:
```yaml
- name: Scan Container for Vulnerabilities
  uses: anchore/scan-action@v3
  with:
    image: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
    fail-build: true
    severity-cutoff: critical
    only-fixed: true  # Only fail on fixable vulnerabilities
```

**What It Does**:
- Scans built container image
- Checks for OS package vulnerabilities
- Checks for application vulnerabilities
- Only fails on critical, fixable issues

**Tools**: Grype, Trivy, Snyk

---

### Step 5: Enforce Environment-Based Deployments

**Implementation**:
```yaml
deploy-staging:
  needs: [build-container]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: staging  # Automatic
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to Staging
      run: ./deploy-staging.sh

deploy-production:
  needs: [deploy-staging]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: production  # Requires manual approval
  steps:
    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: ./deploy-production.sh
```

**What It Does**:
- Staging deploys automatically after build
- Production requires manual approval
- Clear separation of environments
- Approval gate before prod

      - name: Push Container Image
        run: |
          docker push ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}

  # Stage 3: Deploy to Staging (Automatic)
  deploy-staging:
    needs: [build-container]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - name: Verify Image Signature
        run: |
          cosign verify ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }}
          
      - name: Deploy to Staging

          kubectl rollout status deployment/app
          
      - name: Run Smoke Tests
        run: ./smoke-tests.sh staging

  # Stage 4: Deploy to Production (Manual Approval)

          echo "Timestamp: $(date)" >> report.md
```

---

## Before and After Comparison

### Before (❌ Insecure)

```
Issues:
- Hard-coded credentials
- No scanning or SBOMs
- Overly broad permissions
- No deployment controls
- Blind and exposed
```

**Reality**: Setup that leaves you blind and exposed

---

### After (✅ Secure)

```
Improvements:
- Token-based authentication
- Automated scanning (dependencies, containers)
- SBOM tracking
- Least privilege permissions
- Environment controls (staging → production)
- Container scanning
- Image signing and verification
- Manual approval gates
```

**Reality**: Each step adds resilience, reducing the chance that a single mistake or vulnerability turns into a breach

---

## Hands-On: Code Cloud Pipeline Demo

### The Repository

Located in: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Step 1**: Clone repository locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/code-cloud-record-store
cd code-cloud-record-store
git checkout -b develop-test
```

**Step 2**: Update workflow trigger
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop-test]  # Add your branch
```

**Step 3**: Initial push (will fail - intentionally!)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial secure pipeline setup"
git push origin develop-test
```

**Result**: Build fails at "Login to Registry" - hardcoded password detected

**Step 4**: Fix authentication
```yaml
# Remove hardcoded password, add token-based auth
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write
  id-token: write

# Use GitHub token instead
password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Step 5**: Add security scanning layers
- Uncomment dependency vulnerability scanning
- Uncomment SBOM generation
- Uncomment container scanning
- Add environment promotion

**Step 6**: Push and watch secure pipeline succeed
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add full security pipeline"
git push origin develop-test
```

### Pipeline Stages Visualized

```
1. ✅ Validate Configuration
2. ✅ Build and Test
   - Install dependencies
   - Run tests
   - Install security tools
   - Scan dependencies
   - Upload security report
3. ✅ Build Container

   - Generate SBOM
   - Upload SBOM
   - Scan SBOM
   - Authenticate (token-based)
   - Scan container vulnerabilities
   - Sign image
   - Push image
4. ✅ Deploy Staging (Automatic)
5. ⏸️ Deploy Production (Manual Approval Required)
```

### What You'll See

**Environment Promotion Report**:
- ✅ All steps completed successfully
- ✅ No vulnerabilities found (or list of found vulnerabilities)
- ✅ SBOM generated and stored
- ✅ Container signed and verified

**If Vulnerabilities Found**:
- Lists each vulnerability
- Shows severity level
- Provides recommended version to update to
- Gives option to remove vulnerable dependency

## Common Security Pipeline Anti-Patterns

### ❌ "Security in Production"
**Problem**: Only checking security after deployment
**Fix**: Shift left - security in CI/CD

### ❌ "Manual Security Checks"
**Problem**: Humans forget, get tired, make mistakes
**Fix**: Automate everything

### ❌ "Broad Permissions"
**Problem**: "Just make it work" with admin access
**Fix**: Least privilege always

### ❌ "No SBOM"
**Problem**: Don't know what's in your software
**Fix**: Generate SBOM for every build

### ❌ "Skip Scanning for Speed"
**Problem**: "We'll fix security later"
**Fix**: Security is non-negotiable, optimize scanning instead

### ❌ "No Image Signing"
**Problem**: Can't verify artifact authenticity
**Fix**: Sign all artifacts

### ❌ "Hardcoded Secrets"
**Problem**: Credentials in code/config
**Fix**: Use secret managers, tokens

## Key Metrics to Track

### Security Pipeline Health

**1. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**
- How quickly vulnerabilities are detected
- Target: < 1 hour after disclosure

**2. Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)**
- How quickly vulnerabilities are fixed
- Target: < 24 hours for critical

**3. Vulnerability Backlog**
- Number of known, unfixed vulnerabilities
- Target: 0 critical, < 10 high

**4. SBOM Coverage**
- % of services with SBOMs
- Target: 100%

**5. False Positive Rate**
- % of security alerts that aren't real issues
- Target: < 20%

**6. Build Failure Rate (Security)**
- % of builds failing security checks
- Trending down over time

## Key Takeaways

1. **Most breaches happen during releases** - When focused on "making it work"

2. **Three major disasters** - SolarWinds, Log4Shell, Target (all release-related)

3. **SREs are last line of defense** - Actually checking when others assume

4. **70% of code isn't yours** - Dependencies are the biggest risk

5. **SBOM is critical** - Log4Shell proved this (mature teams: hours, immature: weeks)

6. **Automate security checks** - Humans forget, computers don't

7. **Least privilege always** - No broad permissions

8. **Sign and verify artifacts** - Trust but verify

9. **Monitor continuously** - Security doesn't stop at deployment

10. **Build security into pipeline** - Not a separate step

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you have automated dependency scanning?
2. Do you generate SBOMs for every build?
3. Are you using least privilege for all services?
4. Do you sign and verify container images?
5. Do you have environment-based deployment gates?
6. How long would it take to identify all services using a vulnerable dependency?
7. Are secrets hardcoded anywhere in your pipeline?
8. Do you monitor for new vulnerabilities after deployment?

---

## Final Thought

> **"Security isn't just about application features, it's about not becoming tomorrow's cybersecurity news headline."**

**The progression**:

Insecure (Before):
- Hardcoded credentials
- No scanning
- Broad permissions
- No controls
- **Blind and exposed**

Secure (After):
- Token authentication
- Automated scanning
- Least privilege
- Environment gates
- **Resilient and protected**

Each small gap can lead to massive breaches. Each security layer adds resilience.

Build security into every step of your pipeline. It's not optional. It's essential.

**Remember**: You're not just deploying code. You're protecting your business.

### 🎯 Interview Summary Script

**"During my internship at Velera, while the company was merging with PSCU and migrating to GitHub, I proposed a full DevSecOps pipeline. The goal was to integrate security at every stage — from developer commits to runtime monitoring.**

**We used:**
- **Talisman** to block secrets at commit time
- **SonarQube** and **PIT** for code quality and SAST
- **OWASP Dependency-Check** and **Trivy** for vulnerability scanning
- **OPA Conftest** and **Kubesec** for secure configuration enforcement
- **OWASP ZAP** for dynamic testing against running applications
- **Falco** and **Kube-bench** for runtime and cluster-level security
- **Prometheus and Grafana** for monitoring and anomaly detection

**The pipeline also included:**
- Slack notifications for real-time visibility
- Approval gates for production promotion
- Automatic rollback on failed health checks

**This approach not only improved our security posture but also aligned with compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS and SOC 2 by ensuring that every build was verifiable, auditable, and secure. We shifted security from being a one-time audit to a continuous, automated process that protected sensitive financial data at every stage of the delivery lifecycle."**
