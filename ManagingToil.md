# SRE Module: Managing Toil

## Overview

Toil is the kind of work that keeps you busy but doesn't move you forward. Every SRE needs to learn how to identify, quantify, and most importantly, eliminate it.

### The Babysitting Story

**Scenario**: An SRE restarting Kafka for the third day in a row because it seemingly keeps running out of resources.

**Reality**: This isn't engineering, it's babysitting.

> **"Toil is the work that you do manually because no one automated it yet, including yourself."**

**The Scale Problem**: At scale, manual just doesn't scale. Manual toil stands in the way of scaling elegantly.

---

## Official SRE Definition of Toil

> **Toil refers to manual, repetitive operational work that provides no enduring value and tends to grow linearly as the system scales.**

### Key Characteristics

**Toil drains time and energy without improving systems.**

**The Growth Problem**: The more your service grows, the more toil it creates - unless you invest in automation.

---

## Six Telltale Signs of Toil

### 1. Requires Direct Human Involvement
The task cannot complete without a human performing steps manually.

### 2. Has Automation Potential
Tasks that could theoretically be automated in the future.

### 3. Provides No Enduring Value
Doesn't contribute to long-term system improvement - benefits are temporary.

### 4. Is Repetitive
Happens again and again, especially on predictable schedules.

### 5. Has Tactical Focus
Concentrated on immediate needs rather than long-term strategy implementation.

### 6. Grows With Service Scale
As the service grows, this task requires more and more time.

**If even some of these boxes are checked, it's probably toil that you're dealing with and it needs to be taken care of urgently.**

---

## Common Examples of Toil

### 1. Manual Deployment Processes
- Pipeline has too many manual steps
- Requires constant intervention from DevOps/SRE
- Every release needs hand-holding

### 2. Repetitive Alert Responses
- Multiple alerts that aren't well-defined
- Require same manual intervention repeatedly
- Always the same fix, never automated

### 3. Routine Configuration Changes
- Becomes part of your routine
- Done manually each time
- No automation in place

### 4. Regular Data Cleanup Tasks
- Manual database pruning
- Log rotation by hand
- Temporary file removal

### 5. User Access Management
- Manual user provisioning
- Permission changes one by one
- Access reviews done manually

### 6. Certificate Renewals
- Certificates always expire (predictable!)
- Manual renewal process
- Reactive instead of automated

**Always Ask Yourself**:
- Could this be a script?
- Could I implement a cron job?
- Could a GitHub Action handle this?

## The Devastating Impact of Unaddressed Toil

### Engineering Impact

#### 1. Burnout
- Repetitive, unrewarding work leads to dissatisfaction
- Fatigue accumulates over time
- Eventually drives people away

#### 2. Opportunity Cost
- Time spent on toil ≠ time spent on engineering improvements
- Every hour of toil = one hour NOT spent on valuable work
- Compounds over weeks, months, years

#### 3. Technical Debt Accumulation
- Taking manual shortcuts instead of automating properly
- Detritus and debt build up over time
- System becomes harder to maintain

#### 4. Skills Atrophy
- Teams focused on operations lose development expertise
- Engineering muscles weaken from lack of use
- Harder to return to building systems

#### 5. Career Stagnation
- Engineers becoming stuck in operational roles
- Trapped in routine work
- Not additive to careers requiring quick learning and adaptation

**Bottom Line**: Toil steals your capacity to engineer better systems.

### Business Impact

#### 1. Slower Time to Market
- Manual processes create bottlenecks
- Everything takes longer
- Competition moves faster

#### 2. Higher Operational Costs
- More people needed as systems grow
- Linear scaling of headcount
- Unsustainable cost structure

#### 3. Reduced Reliability
- Manual processes are incredibly error-prone
- Human mistakes compound
- Inconsistent execution

#### 4. Scaling Limitations
- Manual operations by default cannot scale effectively
- Hit capacity walls
- Growth becomes constrained

#### 5. Competitive Disadvantage
- Companies with lower toil can simply innovate faster
- You're running while competitors sprint
- Market share loss

## Measuring Toil

### Quantitative Measurements

#### 1. Time Tracking
- Engineers log time spent on different categories
- Categorize percentage of time: toil vs. engineering work
- Provides hard data for decision-making

#### 2. Ticket Counting
- Count tickets that represent traditional toil work
- Track trends over time
- Identify which areas generate most toil

#### 3. Automation Gap Analysis
- Identify manual steps in workflows
- Calculate potential time savings
- Prioritize automation opportunities

#### 4. On-Call Burden
- Hours spent responding manually to alerts
- Repetitive alert patterns
- Manual remediation frequency

---

### Qualitative Assessment

#### 1. Engineer Surveys
- Ask engineers to identify biggest sources of toil
- Gather subjective experience
- Uncover hidden pain points

#### 2. Job Satisfaction Tracking
- Correlate toil levels with satisfaction
- Inverse correlation is typical
- Early warning system for burnout

#### 3. Toil Amnesty
- Safe space for engineers to discuss hidden toil
- Sometimes a taboo subject on teams
- Encourages honest disclosure

#### 4. Value Stream Mapping
- Visualize workflows to identify manual steps
- See bottlenecks clearly
- Prioritize improvements

#### 5. Shadow Programs
- Team members observe operations teams
- Identify undocumented toil
- Surface work that's "just how we do things"

**Best Practice**: Use both qualitative and quantitative signals to make the right toil identification and reduction strategies.

## The Toil Reduction Hierarchy

Work from most to least effective:

### 1. ELIMINATE (Best)
**Remove the need for the work entirely**

**Example**: Replace a flaky service instead of constantly restarting it

**Impact**: Toil disappears completely
**Effort**: Often requires significant upfront investment
**ROI**: Highest long-term return

---

### 2. AUTOMATE (Excellent)
**Create systems that perform the work without human intervention**

**Example**: Automate certificate renewal with Let's Encrypt + cert-manager

**Impact**: Toil reduced to monitoring automation
**Effort**: Moderate development time
**ROI**: High return, scales infinitely

---

### 3. SIMPLIFY (Good)
**Reduce the complexity and time required**

**Example**: Consolidate multiple monitoring dashboards into one

**Impact**: Toil remains but takes less time
**Effort**: Moderate refactoring
**ROI**: Immediate productivity gains

---

### 4. DELEGATE (Acceptable)
**Move the work to more appropriate teams or systems**

**Example**: Create self-service tools for user management

**Impact**: Toil moves off SRE team
**Effort**: Tool creation + user training
**ROI**: Frees up SRE capacity

---

### 5. BATCH (Last Resort)
**Perform the work less frequently and in larger groups**

**Example**: Weekly manual report instead of daily

**Impact**: Reduced frequency, not elimination
**Effort**: Minimal
**ROI**: Small efficiency gain

**If you cannot get rid of the toil, batch it - but keep looking for ways to eliminate it.**

---

## Quantifying Toil Costs

To secure resources for toil reduction, quantify its costs.

### Direct Costs

#### 1. Labor Hours
**Engineering time × Hourly cost**

Example: 15 hours/week × $75/hour × 8 engineers = $4,800/week

#### 2. Incident Costs
- Downtime due to manual errors
- Revenue impact of outages
- Customer trust erosion

#### 3. Scaling Costs
- Additional headcount needed as services grow
- Linear team growth with workload
- Unsustainable hiring trajectory

---

### Indirect Costs

#### 1. Opportunity Cost
- Engineering improvements NOT made
- Features NOT shipped
- Innovations NOT pursued

#### 2. Attrition Costs
- Turnover due to low job satisfaction
- Recruitment expenses
- Lost tribal knowledge
- Ramp-up time for replacements

#### 3. Velocity Impact
- Feature delivery slows
- Time to market increases
- Competitive disadvantage

## Real Cost Calculation Example

### Team Scenario
- **Team Size**: 8 engineers
- **Toil per Engineer**: 15 hours/week
- **Hourly Rate**: $75/hour

### Annual Calculation
```
Weekly cost: 15 hours × $75 × 8 engineers = $4,800
Annual cost: $4,800 × 52 weeks = $249,600

With overhead (benefits, etc.): ~$468,000/year
```

**That's $468,000 per year in unproductive work.**

**What could that budget buy?**
- Powerful automation tooling
- Dedicated automation engineers
- Infrastructure improvements
- Training and development

**Key Question**: Are we spending this money wisely, or could we invest it better?

## Cultural Requirements for Toil Reduction

Reducing toil successfully requires cultural support, not just technical skills.

### 1. Value Engineering Over Heroics
- ✅ Celebrate automation
- ❌ Don't glorify manual firefighting
- 🏆 Applaud engineers who reduce lines of code, not just add them

**Mindset Shift**: The hero who automates away a problem > the hero who manually fixes it every day

---

### 2. Time Allocation
- Explicit budget for toil reduction
- Protected time for automation work
- Not just "when you have time"

**Example**: 20% of sprint dedicated to toil reduction

---

### 3. Psychological Safety
- Safe to identify and address toil
- No blame for raising problems
- Encouraged to surface hidden work

**Culture**: "We have toil" is a problem to solve, not a failure to hide

---

### 4. Knowledge Sharing
- Ritual sharing of automation knowledge
- Documentation of solutions
- Cross-team learning

**Practice**: Weekly demos of automation wins

---

### 5. Continuous Improvement Mindset
- Toil reduction is an opportunity
- Always asking "can we automate this?"
- Celebration of incremental progress

**Philosophy**: Every bit of toil eliminated makes the system better

---

### 6. Bias for Boring, Maintainable Solutions
- Choose simple, proven approaches
- Avoid over-engineering automation
- Make it easy for others to maintain

**Principle**: The best automation is the kind anyone can understand and fix

---

## Key Principle

> **"Toil isn't a badge of honor. It's a signal to automate and evolve."**

Working harder isn't the goal - working smarter is.
